/// Represents abstract robot model with general properties that every kit has, like the ability to connect to robot,
/// configure devices or enumerate available ports. It can be specialized in kit plugins to provide kit-specific
/// functionality and to define kit-specific methods like establishing connection.
///
/// Model can be connected or disconnected to robot, when it is disconnected, it will queue up device
/// configuration changes and ignore requests involving physical devices. Some models (like 2d model) are assumed to be
/// always connected.
///
/// Life cycle of a model is as follows:
/// - Model is created in Disconnected state.
/// - Model is initialized (by calling init() method), which loads plugin-specific info that can not be loaded in
///   constructor.
/// - Model connects to a real robot by calling connectToRobot(). When connection is established
///   (or failed to establish), model enters Connected state and emits connected() signal.
/// - Model is then configured by configureDevice() calls which add to the current configuration devices that can
///   be selected by user. Some devices can be configured by model itself, like display or speaker.
/// - Configuration is applied by applyConfiguration() call. It queues current configuration to be uploaded to actual
///   robot when model is connected, or, if it is already connected, uploads it to robot immediately.
///   After all devices respond that they are configured, model emits allDevicesConfigured(). Some devices may fail to
///   configure for some reason, so actual configuration status shall be retrieved by configuration() call.
/// - After allDevicesConfigured() signal model is ready to work and accept commands to a robot. Configuration still
///   can be changed "on the fly" by configureDevice() and applyConfiguration() calls, model tries to reconfigure
///   device and emits allDevicesConfigured() when done.
/// - Robot can be disconnected for some internal reason (for example, by physical connection loss) or by calling
///   disconnectFromRobot() method. Anyway, model enters Disconnected state and emits disconnected() signal.
///   Model can be reconnected again by calling connectToRobot().
/// All implementations are required to emit allDevicesConfigured() after connected().
